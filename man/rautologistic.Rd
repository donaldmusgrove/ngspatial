\title{Return a perfect sample from a centered autologistic model.}
\usage{
rautologistic(X, A, theta)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{the design matrix.}

\item{A}{the adjacency matrix for the underlying graph. The matrix need not be binary, but it must be numeric and symmetric.}

\item{theta}{the vector of parameter values: \eqn{\theta = (\beta^\prime, \eta)^\prime}{\theta = (\beta', \eta)'}.}
}
\value{
A vector that is distributed exactly according to the centered autologistic model with the given design matrix and parameter values.
}
\description{
Return a perfect sample from a centered autologistic model.
}
\details{
This function implements a perfect sampler for the centered autologistic model. The sampler employs coupling from the past.
