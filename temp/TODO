- Create multivariate logistic internal function
  o Needs to take as input number of trials, k, for each observation
  o For k=1, we have binary observations
  
- Create multivariate gaussian internal function

- 'Pre-smooth' by right-multiplying M by the inverse of the Cholesky of Qs
  o Need the option of not doing this for every outcome if a single common design
    matrix is used
